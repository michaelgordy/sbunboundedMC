The power of our backtests is highly sensitive to the choice of v-transform and to parameters of the DGP when the true DGP $F$ is the Fernandez-Steel distribution. The exercises below are intended to shed light on these relationships. The notation $F(\cdot; df,\gamma)$ refers to the *standardized* FS distribution with *df* degrees of freedom and asymmetry parameter $\gamma$. A few key properties of this distribution:

* If $X\sim F(df,\gamma)$ then $-X\sim F(df,1/\gamma)$. 
* The skewness of $X$ is increasing in $\gamma$.

```{r}
source("DefineFmodels.R")
source("DefineVtransforms.R")

n <- 500000  # sample size
uu <- runif(n) # to facilitate comparison across FS parameter values

# For df=10, gma=6/5 similar to alpha=1
# For df=5, gma=6/5 similar to alpha=2/3

df <- 5
gma <- 6/5

x <- qsst_fs(uu,df,gma)
xsst <- rscaledskewed_t_sn(df,2/3)(n)
```

The value of $\gamma=6/5$ delivers skewness around 2.9, which is comparable to the
