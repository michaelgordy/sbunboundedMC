Size and power simulations for paper *Spectral Backtests Unbounded*. 

Note:

* The main scripts to run are *sizepower1.R*, *sizepower2.R*, *sizepower_tlsf.R*.
* Scripts *simSetup.R*, *DefineUtilities.R*, *DefineKernels.R*, and *DefineVtransforms.R* contain code that is shared across the main scripts, in part to ensure consistency. 
* Results are written to Folder *output*. Final publication-ready outputs are transferred manually to folder *output_publication* to protect from overwriting.
