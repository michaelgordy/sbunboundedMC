Generating tables and figures for paper *Spectral Backtests Unbounded and Folded*. 

Numbering of the filenames aligns to the initial submission of our paper to the *Journal of Financial Econometrics* in November 2024.

* All scripts assume the working directory is the project root folder, not the *R* subfolder. 
* Results are written to folder *output*.  
* Table 3 summarizes theoretical properties of TLSF kernels so needs no replication.
* The Berkowitz column of Table 4 is generated separately in `table4_berkowitz.R`.
* Tables 5, 6 and 7 are generated by script `tables_section4.R`. Set variable `makeTable` to control which table is generated.
* Scripts *simSetup.R*, *DefineFmodels.R*, *DefineKernels.R*, and *DefineVtransforms.R* contain code that is shared across the main scripts, in part to ensure consistency. 
* Package dependencies include `spectralBacktest`, `simsalapar`, `future`, `parallelly`, `furrr`, `purrr`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `tibble`, `stringi`, `forcats`, `skewt`, `moments`, `gt`, `ggplot2`, `viridis`, `RColorBrewer`, `patchwork`, `latex2exp`, `grDevices`.
